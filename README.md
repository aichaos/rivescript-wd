# RiveScript Working Draft

This repository tracks the Working Draft for the RiveScript scripting language.
The Working Draft is the language specification for the features and syntax of
RiveScript from an implementation-agnostic point of view.

The document is formatted as reStructuredText and was initially converted over
from the Perl POD format in which it was originally written on 1/29/2015.

Feature requests and scripting language revisions should be made against this
repository; bug reports for existing implementations of RiveScript interpreters
should be directed to their respective repositories instead.

# Implementations

See <http://www.rivescript.com/interpreters> for a full list of RiveScript
implementations in various programming languages.
